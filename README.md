## About the project
Very basic video conferencing web app with displaying 3D models side by. Participants could interact with the 3D model during the call. Anyone can point out a specific label on the 3D model, rotating the 3D model to that spot on every participant's end. Integrated with DialogFlow, questioning about specific label produces an answer to which the 3D model rotates to. This project was the winning project on the Hackathon.

Made for Make-A-Ton 2020 Hackathon.
